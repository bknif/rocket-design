# rocket-design
Powerful tools for an introduction to rocket design. This repository is intended to indroduce students and people of all ages into the intricies of rocket design. While this repository focuses specifically on engine design, there will be smaller files which display aspects such as tank design, fin sizing, trade studies, etc. It should be noted that many of these files require ITAR (International Traffic in Arms) protected software such as REFPROP and NASA CEA. As a result, some of these files may not be executable for some users. In order to run some of these scripts, you may need to move a copy of REFPROP or NASA CEA into the proper location. If you are not a US Citizen or have not gained access to such software, there will be .mat files which contained a sample output of the code to provide an idea of how to execute certain analysis.
