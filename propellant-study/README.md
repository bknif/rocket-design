# Propellant Study
## About the Code
Propellant_Study.m is a script which provides a framework for evaluating the specific impulse, mass flow, volume flow, chamber temperature, etc. based on an input of required thrust, chamber pressure, and nozzle exit pressure for a range of propellant combinations. The specific equations used to determine the code outputs can be found in the wiki under propellant study. It should be noted that this code requires NASA CEA and REFPROP. As a result, the propellants that can be evaluated are limited to the CEA and REFPROP fluid libraries. If the code takes a while to run, you can reduce N, remove fuel/oxidizers, or change the loop to be run for specific propellant combinations.
